# Pacman with python

This is a simple Pacman game which I'm currently working on. In order to start the game, you must first:
 - Install [pygame](https://pypi.org/project/pygame/)
 - Then run the file called `main.py`

## Controls:
A - left arrow key(\⬅️) - Going to the right <br>
S - down arrow key(\⬇️) - Going down <br>
W - up arrow key(\⬆️) - Going up <br>
D - right arrow key(\➡️) - Going to the left <br>
