# Pacman with python

This is a simple Pacman game which I'm currently working on. In order to start the game, you must first:
 - Install [pygame](https://pypi.org/project/pygame/)
 - Then run the file called `main.py`

## Controls:
W - up arrow key(⬆️) - Going up <br>
A - left arrow key(⬅️) - Going to the right <br>
S - down arrow key(⬇️) - Going down <br>
D - right arrow key(➡️) - Going to the left <br>

### Use:
P - To pause the Game
F - To quit the game
