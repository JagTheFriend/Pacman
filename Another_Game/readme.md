# A Simple SHooting with python

This is a simple Shooting game which I'm currently working on. In order to start the game, you must first:
 - Install [pygame](https://pypi.org/project/pygame/)
 - Then run the file called `main.py`

## Controls:
W - Going up <br>
A - Going to the right <br>
S - Going down <br>
D - Going to the left <br>
Space Bar - To Shoot
